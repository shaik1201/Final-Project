- scraping from other sites
- improving the prompt for extracting more features
- improving the UI
- adding options to search by other features (not only the title of the job)
- optional: let the user upload a cv and offer relevant jobs
- how should we save the jobs? (currently they are being saved in mongodb
using the scrape button that triggers the indeed_jobs script)
- improving search functionality.
(e.g searching for "data analyst student" should work even though the
jobs look like: "data analyst - student")

Or and Ofek - Show the jobs as cards like in LinkedIn + Improve the UI based on what we wrote:
"3.3.1 Homepage and Navigation
Homepage Design: The homepage should feature a simple and prominent search bar for inputting skills or job titles, alongside options for advanced search filters such as location, job type, and industry. Sections for trending jobs and an overview of platform features could also be included for immediate user engagement.
Simple Navigation Menu: A streamlined navigation menu providing access to the job search page, an about page detailing the platform's purpose and functionality, and a contact or support page for user inquiries."
