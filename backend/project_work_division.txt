- scraping other sites
- improving the prompt for extracting more features
- improving the UI
- adding options to search by other features (not only the title of the job)
- optional: let the user upload a cv and offer relevant jobs
- how should we save the jobs? (currently they are being saved in mongodb
using the scrape button that triggers the indeed_jobs script)
- improving search funciotionality. 
(e.g searching for "data analyst student" should work even though the
jobs look like: "data analyst - student")
